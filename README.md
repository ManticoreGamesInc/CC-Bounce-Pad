## Finding the Component

This component can be found under the **CoreAcademy** account on Community Content.

## Overview

The bounce pad component will allow creators to place these around the map which could be used to get to certain
areas of the level that could be unreachable by other means.

Bounce pads add an element of fun, and are usually great for obbys.

## How to use

Drop the Bounce Map component into the Hierarchy. The root of the component contains various properties that can be changed.

There is an example template with a very basic obby to show how this component could be used.

- **BounceStrength**

	The strength of the velocity that will be applied to the player.

- **EnableRagdollAfter**

	If greater than 0, the player will be ragdolled when this duration has passed.

- **Direction**

	The direction of the velocity.
